our [community](community.md) to help build the next evolution in game development!

## Game Development Redefined

**Sandium** is an innovative open-source framework designed to revolutionize game development. 
Unlike traditional methods that require building a game from the ground up, Sandium empowers creators to start with a 
**fully functional base game** and seamlessly customize it using **existing mods or their own creations**.

With Sandium, the focus shifts from tedious groundwork to creative innovation. Whether you're an aspiring developer, 
a seasoned modder, or a hobbyist, Sandium provides the tools to bring your ideas to life with minimal barriers.

### Written in Java

Sandium is built in **Java**, chosen for its versatility and security. Mods in Sandium are run through a **bytecode analyzer** 
to ensure they are fully sandboxed, preventing malicious code from compromising the game or user systems. This robust 
layer of protection gives developers and players confidence in the integrity of the mods they use. Additionally, 
Sandium supports writing **GPU shaders directly in Java**, which are seamlessly converted to run on the GPU, combining 
Java's accessibility with the high-performance graphics capabilities demanded by modern games. This unique approach 
makes Sandium both secure and powerful.

### Mod-Centric Approach 

Sandium embraces a **mod-centric approach**, making customization and creativity the core of its ecosystem. Mods are hosted
in a **Maven repository**, where every user and developer gets **1 GB of free storage** to share their creations. 
Advanced developers can leverage Java to write complex and dynamic mods, while casual users can create simpler mods, 
like blueprints for structures they design directly within Sandium. This inclusive system ensures that anyone, 
regardless of skill level, can contribute to and benefit from a vibrant modding community, fostering collaboration 
and innovation.

### Powerful Built-In Features for Modern Game Development

Sandium is packed with features designed to meet the needs of modern developers. It leverages the **Vulkan API** for 
high-performance graphics, ensuring smooth and visually stunning experiences. Core functionalities like **multiplayer 
support** and **save/load game systems** are integrated from the start, so developers can focus on creativity rather than 
reinventing essential mechanics. These robust, out-of-the-box capabilities make Sandium a strong foundation for any 
game project.
